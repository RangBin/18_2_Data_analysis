Code backup for the project in 2018.


SUMMARY 

In this project, a model that classifies a person's movement was created using the Feedback Neural Network (FFN) and Decision Tree Classifier (DTC).
In terms of Accuracy Rate, FFNN was found to be better than DTC's.
In the FFNN model, Tanh and ReLu were used as the activation function, and the results were analyzed to confirm that the ReLU had an advantage in terms of the calculated quantity.
In addition, the model's Accuracy Test with Original Data and Preprocessed Data revealed a clearer distinction between similar movements when using preprocessed data.

key words: wearable sensors; machine learning; motion classifier; FFNN; decision tree classifier
